## Project Descriptions

### Task 1 : Stock Prediction
- **Predicting Stock Prices with LSTM :** Explore this data science project to predict stock prices using historical data of Google's stock prices and related attributes with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.
- This project provides precise predictions for Google's future closing prices, empowering stakeholders with valuable insights to make informed investment decisions. Dive into the code, data preprocessing, model creation, and visualization of actual vs. predicted stock prices.

### Task 2 : Titanic Classification 
- **Titanic Survival Prediction :** Explore this data science project to build a predictive model that answers the question: 'What sorts of people were more likely to survive the Titanic disaster?'
- Dive into data preparation, visualization, and the creation of various classification models, ultimately identifying the best-performing model. Witness the power of data science in understanding historical events.

### Task 3 : Number Recognition
- **Number Recognition with Neural Networks :** Explore the world of Handwritten Digit Recognition using the MNIST dataset and a powerful neural network. This project dives into the realm of computer vision and machine learning to accurately identify handwritten digits (0-9) with high precision.
- From data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, this code provides a comprehensive insight into the process. Unleash the potential of neural networks and enhance your understanding of image classification tasks.
